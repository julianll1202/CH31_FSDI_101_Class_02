        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>My name is Julian Lopez Luna, I was born in <u>Mexicali, Baja California</u> and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in <b>Computer Systems Engineering</b> at <em>Instituto Tecnologico de Mexicali</em> . As someone who is just discovering programming and software development, my current goal is to learn as much as I can about new technologies that are being used in big companies.</p>
        <p>Aside from that I am a fan of pop culture in general, I like to read, both books and comics, listen to music, watch movies and tv shows, and I also like to draw. </p>
